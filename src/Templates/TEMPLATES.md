TEMPLATES
=========

Templates are stored here.

They can be straight PHP, or whatever. But you need to load the templates through a templates controller. The templates controller can bundle up all the templates, or it can send the templates one by one which can be downloaded asynchronously.

You'll need a main template that will load up the main view.
